    <h3>Station (QTH) Antennas</h3>
	<p>
	  All antennas are still of a temporary nature.  Because of that the antennas change
	  quite a bit.  This page gives only an idea of what antenna I'm currently using.
    </p>
    <dl>
	  <dt>Long wire with Icom AT-130 tuner</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <a href="20191130_152318.jpg"><img src="20191130_152318-small.jpg" /></a>
		<p>Thanks to the Icom AT-130 tuner I can work this antenna with ease on the whole HF spectrum.
		In the winter time I've been making many contacts on 160m with the antenna.</p>
		<p>The photo gives an idea of where the wire (red) and tuner (orange) are locate.  It's quite 
		hard to see the wire going from the river birch to the pine tree.  I attached a light weight
		string to a drone, flew it across the tree, and let the drone drop.  With that process I 
		got a rope over both trees with which I pulled up the wire. On a different long wire I used 
		14 gauge stranded electrical wire that evenually broke due to the sway and strain on the wire.
		For this installation I used a stainless steel wire and strong rope to hang it.  In the river 
		birch the wire goes through a stainless steel ring so the supporting rope would not break from
		the movement of the steel wire.

      <dt>Homemade 10 &amp; 20 meter dipole</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>My first dipole antenna.  I haven't made any contacts as I only got a
        lot of static on 10 meters.  I upgraded the dipole by adding a home made 1:1
		current balun and added a 20m dipole wire as well.  Since then I have made a
		contact on 10m and may contacts on 20m.  In fact this is my best 20m antenna which
		also has gotten me a contact with Cook Island.</p>
		<p>I played with the 10m wires, shortening it to 6m but basically that was unsuccessfull
		and currently is not resonant on any frequency.  However the 20m still goes strong.  With
		recently aquired amplifier I hung that antenna up again and talked to two stations in 
		South Africa using SSB</P>

      <dt>Homemade 20/40/80 meter dipole</dt>
      <dd>

        <a href="20170331_075318.jpg"><img src="20170331_075318-small.png" /></a>

        <p>My first working HF antenna.  The design is a parallel dipole antenna with
        the 80 meter being a folded dipole. The 80 meter wire turned out to be too
        short so only 20 and 40 meters are useful.  Since I shorened the 20 meter
        insulated wire by folding it back on itself I can't use the 20m band when
        the antenna is wet.  The SWR skyrockets.  None the less the 20 and 40 meter
        band work quite well even at the antennas temporary location which is only
        15 foot off the ground.</p>

	<h3>Portable Antennas</h3>
	<dl>
  	  <dt>Homemade multiband clothesline reel antenna</dt>
  	  <dd>
        <p>For portable operation, this antenna goes up to 60m.  All the copper in the spool
        is quite heavy which needs to be considered when using higher frequencies.  Removing the 60m
        support and going only up to 40m would help a lot.  Then an extension could be added for 60m
        and 80m when desired.  The antenna works supprisingly good.</p>
      </dd>

  	  <dt>Homemade 10 meter vertical dipole antenna</dt>
  	  <dd>
        <p>Works great for portable operation when mounted on a windsock pole that is being
  	    held by a bicycle workstand (my tripod alternative).</p>
      </dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Mobile Antennas</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dt>Ham Sticks</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>I have a collection of ham sticks for 17m, 20m, and 40m that mount on my custom 3/8" x 24 treaded mount on the car roof.</p>
	  </dd>
  	  
	  <dt>TRAM 1185-BNC VHF/UHF magnetic antenna</dt>
  	  <dd>
        <p>For occasional vehicle usage.  The antenna whistles in the wind, yes sometimes
  	    it's windy enough here that you hear it even when parked.  Otherwise probably OK,
  		  although I haven't used it much.</p>
      </dd>
	  
	  <dt>TRAM 1184 VHF/UHF antenna</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>To use my custom 3/8" X 24 treaded mount.<p>
	  </dd>
	</dl>

    <h3>Hand Held Antennas</h3>
	<dl>
  	  <dt>Tape measure antennas</dt>
  	  <dd>
        <p>I have one for 2m and a cute little one for 70cm.  They work great and get me to
  	    the repeater of the neighbouring town without a problem.  I have used both of them
  		  quite often to join their weekly net.  The antenna works great in fox hunts expecially
        with an attenuator.</p>
      </dd>
	  
	  <dt>Arrow II Portable (146/437-10BP)</dt>
	  <dd>
	    <p>Primarely for satellite work but I haven't done much of that.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	
    <h3>Archived Antennas</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>RadioWavz 20/40 dipole</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I got the DP4-2 antenna with my first radio, the Icom IC-7300 from Ham
        Radio Outlet.  It should have been a simple beginners antenna but the SWR
        is way off.  It turns out that the inner wire between the balun and the
        traps is to short for the 20m band.  Not something that's easily corrected.
        Needles to say I haven't used this antenna.</p>
